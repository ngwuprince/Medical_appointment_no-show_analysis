# Medical_appointment_no-show_analysis
This report analyses a dataset of more than 110k Brazilian patients from late April to early June 2016. Data shows that in 20% of scheduled appointments, the patient didn't show up. Our goal is trying to answer the question: what are the factors leading to no_shows? Is it the system or personal attributes to blame?
The report distinguishes between two groups of factors that might have significance: those related to the system, and personal attributes of the patients themselves

**At the end of the analysis, the following questions was answered:**
- Question 1: Who goes to the doctor often, Male or Females with a higher rate?
- Question 2: at what hour of the day do people show up the most?
- Question 3: among people that showed up, what mean age bracket are they and at what mean hour did they show up?
- Question 4: which medical condition category has the highest rate of appointments?
- Question 5: Does medical condition affects appointment show rate?
- Question 6: Which Gender suffers more of a given medical condition? 
- Question 7: Does medical treatment scholarship has effect on show rate?
